# DevOps
- Frequent feature deployments
- Reduce time between bug fixes
- Reduce failure rate of releases
- Quicker recovery time in case of release failures.

## SSH
- Secure Shell
- administration Protocal
- lets users have access and control the remote servers over the Internet to work using the command line.
- SSH is a secured encrypted version

## Config-Management
- Config Identification
  - define product
  - its configuration 
  - documentation
  - identification
- change management
  - Control changes to a product
  - its configuration
  - documentation
- config status accounting
  - provide status & info
  - its configuration
  - documentation
- config Audit
  - verify consitency of all

## CAMS
- Culture
- Automate
- Mesurement
- sharing

## Continuous Integration
- Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that makes sure developers integrate their code into a shared repository as and when they are done working on the feature. Each integration is verified by means of an automated build process that allows teams to detect problems in their code at a very early stage rather than finding them after the deployment.
- The CI server keeps track of the changes done to the shared repository and it pulls the changes as soon as it detects them.
- The CI server then triggers the build of the code and runs unit and integration test cases if set up.
- The team is informed of the build results. In case of the build failure, the team has to work on fixing the issue as early as possible, and then the process repeats

## Continuous Testing
- Using this phase will help the team to test each build continuously (as soon as the code developed is pushed) thereby giving the dev teams a chance to get instant feedback on their work and ensuring that these problems don’t arrive in the later stages of SDLC cycle.

## KPI
- Key Performance Indicator
- Reduce the average time taken to recover from a failure.
- Increase Deployment frequency in which the deployment occurs.
- Reduced Percentage of failed deployments.

## Different phases in DevOps methodology.
- planning
- Development
- Continuous Integration
- Deployment
- Operations
- Monetering

## Differentiate between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment
  - The deployment to the production environment is fully automated and does not require manual/ human intervention.
- Continuous Delivery
  - In this process, some amount of manual intervention with the manager’s approval is needed for deployment to a production environment.

## Memcached
- Memcached is an open-source and free in-memory object caching system
- It is mainly used for speeding the dynamic web applications by reducing the database load
  - Profile caching
    - social media Domain
  - Web page caching
    - content aggretion Domain
  - Session caching
    - e-commerce, gaming, entertainement Domains
  - Database query
    - location-based service Domains
