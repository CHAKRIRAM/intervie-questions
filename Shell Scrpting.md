# Shell Scrpting
- A file called **sh** stores shell programs
- Text files containing commands to execute by a shell are called shell scripts.
- it is considered to be the easiest programming language to use
- Automation of the code compiling process
- Run a program or create an environment for programming.
- Complete batch processing and file manipulation.
- Integrate existing programs.
- Perform routine backups.

##  limitations of shell scripting
- Errors are frequent and costly, and a single error can alter the command.
- The execution speed is slow
- Bugs or inadequacies in the language's syntax or implementation
- Large, complex tasks aren't well suited to it.

## Shell variable
```
variable ="Hello" 
echo $variable
```
## different types of variables
- System-defined variables(**environment variable**)
  - it's in Capital Letters **ex:SHELL**
